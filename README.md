## Objective
 Create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that you will write. Your app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password can include special characters.

Your application must:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked.
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
* Length of password:
  * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
* Character types:
  * Lowercase
  * Uppercase
  * Numeric
  * Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

### Steps Taken
I started by creating prompts and alerts to generate user password preference and did some research on how to return a boolean instead of a string for the characters preference.

Once those where set up I created a while loop at first but it caused my code to repeat over and over again.

I enlisted the help of a tutor who assisted with the loops and talked me through the rest of the code step by step.

I'll review the rubric matrix and make small adjustments where required.
